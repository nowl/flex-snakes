This is a simple "snakes" style game using Flixel and Adobe Flex. This
was primarily a learning experience for Adobe Flex and I figured what
better way than to build a simple game.

The source may be useful to others wanting to build games using the
Flixel library. After using it for the first time I can say that it's
very easy to do many things however similar to most frameworks you are
somewhat constrained. Doing things that are not explicitly built in to
the framework can require some roundabout methods.

The goal is to obtain the highest score possible by guiding the snake
around the board and eat as many bananas as possible while avoiding
both the green shrubs and the constantly growing snake body. Movement
is done through drawing out a path using the mouse. This makes it more
strategic in that the path can be drawn out far in advance as opposed
to relying on quick-reflexes when changing directions with the arrow
keys like traditional snake games.
